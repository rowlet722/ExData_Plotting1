## Readme

This repo contains the submission for **Course Project 1 of Coursera:Exploratory Data Analysis**  

There are 4 R scripts plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R. These will respectively create the required plots of the same name in a png format. 

To run the scripts the "household_power_consumption.txt" file must be in the same directory as the scripts.

NOTE : To run the scripts the R packages *data.table*, *dplyr* and *lubridate* should be installed.
